# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "test"
  test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up a Java JDK environment for Maven
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: maven # Caches dependencies for faster builds

      # 3. Sets up Google Chrome and a matching ChromeDriver
      # This is crucial for running your Selenium UI tests
      - name: Set up Chrome
        uses: browser-actions/setup-chrome@v1

      # 4. Runs the tests using the Maven wrapper
      # The `-B` flag runs Maven in non-interactive (batch) mode
      - name: Run Selenium tests with Maven
        run: mvn -B test

      # 5. (Optional but recommended) Uploads the test reports
      # This step will run even if the previous test step fails
      - name: Upload TestNG reports
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
